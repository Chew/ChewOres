The mod is currently in alpha, there will be more ores added eventually...
 
Want an ore? Just tell me the name of the ore, and I will try to add it when I have time!
 
Current Ores:
 - Blood Diamonds (Idea from MrJoCrafter)
 
Sure, use this mod in a modpack, not sure why you would want to as it is in alpha, but fair enough.
Serious Edition: I give anyone permission to use this mod in their modpack so long as somewhere they credit me and not try to copy this off as their own.
